# kpi_boxes


Hello, for a personal project, I wanted to code a section displaying the main KPI (number client, client satisfaction ...) on my landing page.
This is very common in a lot of website to quickly show achievment to potential new client visiting the website. We will refered that as KPI boxes
in this articles.

Yet, I found a lot of a repository coding complex KPI dashboard to monitor website impact, but not simple KPI boxes as I wanted, so I decided to do it here!

Of course, you can customize CSS property as much as you like depending on your website design, creativity and probably because you have better design skills
than mine.
