# kpi_boxes


For a personal project, I wanted to code a section displaying the main KPI (number of clients, client satisfaction …) on my landing page. This is very common in a lot of websites to quickly show achievements to potential new clients visiting the page. We will refer to that as KPI boxes in this article.

Yet, I found a lot of repository coding complex KPI dashboards to monitor website impact with graphs, but not for simple KPI boxes as I wanted, so I decided to do it here!

Of course, you can customize CSS properties as much as you like depending on your website design, creativity and probably
because you might have better design skills than mine.
